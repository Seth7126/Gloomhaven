Unhappy with the difficulty curve of Gloomhaven?
Came to the game expecting something a bit more accessible?
Or maybe you're just sad that the art team did all these wonderful animations for attacks that just aren't viable to use.

This mod removes Burn from abilities and turns permanent burn into regular burn.

Abilities that were burned when used previously now are just discarded, and those that would be Permanently burned are now just burned, with the exclusion of Reviving Ether which stays as default.

This mod is for both guildmaster and campaign mode, and was made for Faust by his request.


Multiplayer compatible


Jaws of the Lion required.

Just in case someone who comes after me may wonder, there is a process to making mods work in gloomhaven. After installing your selected mod, you then create a custom ruleset and select it. after this sis done you click your ruleset, hit compile, then play game. The above mod makes it so that the normal burn cards simply discard. It does still burn when you rest, so its not infinite, but as someone who couldnt wrap his brain around this game after research and study and was about to set it aside, this one tweak let me actually really enjoy it. Big thanks to Shepard for the Mod :)
